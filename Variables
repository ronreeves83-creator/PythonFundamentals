Python Syntax Basics — Variables

Variables in Python are labels that reference values stored in memory.
You don’t declare types — Python figures that out for you (dynamic typing).
Think of variables like named containers that hold data.

🌱 Creating Variables Samples

name = "Ron"
age = 41
is_admin = True
salary = 85000.50

Python uses = to assign values.
No keyword needed. No semicolon. No drama.

🧠 Variable Naming Rules

Python is chill, but not that chill — follow these rules:

✔ Must start with a letter or underscore
✔ Can contain letters, numbers, underscores
✔ Case-sensitive (age ≠ Age)
✔ Cannot use Python keywords (class, def, for, etc.)

Good names

first_name = "Ron"
user_id = 1023
account_balance = 150.00


Bad names

1name = "Ron"       # ❌ can't start with number
user-id = 22         # ❌ hyphens not allowed
class = "Python"     # ❌ reserved keyword

🔄 Reassigning Variables

Variables can change types on the fly.

x = 10        # integer
x = "hello"   # now it's a string


This is dynamic typing — powerful, but handle with care in bigger apps.

🔍 Checking a Variable’s Type
x = 99
print(type(x))    # <class 'int'>


This saves you when debugging weird behavior.

🧮 Multiple Assignments

Python loves shortcuts.

a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
x = y = z = "same value"


Clean, elegant, and readable.

📦 Unpacking (SUPER Useful)

When working with lists, tuples, and automation scripts:

coords = (32.5, -84.9)
lat, lon = coords


Or:

name, age, city = ["Ron", 41, "Columbus"]

🔐 Constants in Python

Python doesn’t have true constants, but by convention:

API_KEY = "123456"
MAX_USERS = 500


ALL CAPS = “don’t touch this.”

🛑 Shadowing Built-in Names (Don’t do this)

Don’t name variables after Python functions.

list = [1, 2, 3]   # ❌ overrides built-in list()
sum = 50          # ❌ overrides sum()


This can break your entire script later.

⚡ Pro Tips for Automation

These matter when you're building bots, scripts, workers, or SaaS tools.

Use descriptive names

Bad:

x = get_users()


Good:

active_users = get_users()

Keep configs as variables
INPUT_FOLDER = "input_files/"
OUTPUT_FOLDER = "processed/"
LOG_ENABLED = True

Track environment values
import os

DB_URL = os.getenv("DB_URL")

📝 Quick Reference Cheatsheet

name = "Ron"                     # string
age = 41                         # integer
height = 5.9                     # float
is_member = True                 # boolean
items = [1, 2, 3]                # list
settings = {"mode": "dark"}      # dict
lat, lon = (32.5, -84.9)         # unpacking
