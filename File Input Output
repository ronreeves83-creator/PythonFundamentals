Python Syntax Basics — File I/O (Input & Output)

File I/O is the backbone of real automation work.
Whether you're cleaning reports, processing church attendance files, exporting CSVs, or uploading logs — File I/O is where Python shines.

This page covers reading, writing, appending, working with JSON/CSV, and using pathlib (the modern way).

📄 1. Opening Files

Python uses the open() function.

Basic pattern
file = open("data.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
file.close()


But the right way is using a context manager (with) — it closes the file automatically.

Recommended
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

📥 2. Reading Files
Read the entire file
with open("notes.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read()

Read line-by-line
with open("notes.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())

Read all lines into a list
with open("notes.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

📤 3. Writing Files
Overwrite (creates file if not exists)
with open("log.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Automation started\n")

Append (add to bottom)
with open("log.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("New entry added\n")

📝 4. Writing Multiple Lines
lines = ["Item 1\n", "Item 2\n", "Item 3\n"]

with open("list.txt", "w") as f:
    f.writelines(lines)

🔧 5. File Modes
"r"  read
"w"  write (overwrite)
"a"  append
"x"  create file, fail if exists
"rb" read binary
"wb" write binary


Binary mode matters for images, audio files, PDFs, etc.

🟦 6. Working with JSON Files

Super useful for configs, reports, or API responses.

Load JSON
import json

with open("data.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

Save JSON
with open("data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

📊 7. Working with CSV Files
Read CSV
import csv

with open("users.csv") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

Write CSV
import csv

rows = [
    ["Name", "Age"],
    ["Ron", 41],
]

with open("users.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(rows)

📂 8. Using Pathlib (HIGHLY recommended)

pathlib is more modern and cleaner than os.

Create paths
from pathlib import Path

folder = Path("reports")
file = folder / "summary.txt"

Check if file exists
if file.exists():
    print("Ready to process")

Read text quickly
content = file.read_text()

Write text quickly
file.write_text("Hello, world!")

🔍 9. Listing Files in a Folder
from pathlib import Path

folder = Path("uploads")

for f in folder.glob("*.pdf"):
    print(f)


Patterns you can use:

*.txt
*.csv
**/*.txt      # recursive

🧹 10. Deleting Files
from pathlib import Path

file = Path("old_file.txt")

if file.exists():
    file.unlink()

🚀 Real Automation Examples
Auto-clean a folder (delete large files)
from pathlib import Path

folder = Path("videos")

for f in folder.glob("*.mp4"):
    if f.stat().st_size > 50_000_000:
        f.unlink()

Combine multiple CSV files
import csv
from pathlib import Path

folder = Path("reports")
output = []

for f in folder.glob("*.csv"):
    with f.open() as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        output.extend(list(reader))

with open("combined.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(output)

Save API results to a JSON file
import requests
import json

data = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data").json()

with open("api_data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

📝 Quick Reference
open("file.txt", "r")         # read
open("file.txt", "w")         # write
open("file.txt", "a")         # append

file.read()                   # read whole file
file.readlines()              # list of lines

json.load()                   # read JSON
json.dump()                   # write JSON

csv.reader()                  # read CSV
csv.writer()                  # write CSV

Path("folder").glob("*.txt")  # list files
Path("file").unlink()         # delete file
