Python Syntax Basics — Loops

Loops let your program repeat actions without rewriting the same code.
In automation, loops are everywhere — renaming files, processing records, scraping pages, cleaning datasets, etc.

Python has two main loop types:
for loops and while loops.

🔁 1. For Loops

Used when you need to iterate over a collection (list, string, dict, set, file, etc.) or a range of numbers.

Basic Example
for i in range(5):
    print(i)


Output:

0
1
2
3
4

Looping Through a List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

Looping Through a String
for char in "Python":
    print(char)

Looping Through a Dictionary
person = {"name": "Ron", "age": 41}

for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, value)

Looping With Index (enumerate)
names = ["Ron", "Jay", "Mike"]

for index, name in enumerate(names):
    print(index, name)

Looping a Specific Number of Times (range)
for i in range(2, 10, 2):
    print(i)


range(start, stop, step)

🔂 2. While Loops

Used when you don’t know exactly how many times you’ll loop — the loop runs as long as the condition is true.

Basic While Loop
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

Avoid Infinite Loops (Common Mistake)
while True:
    print("This runs forever")


Always add a break condition.

Using break to Stop a Loop
for num in range(10):
    if num == 5:
        break
    print(num)

Using continue to Skip an Iteration
for num in range(6):
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num)

Using pass as a Placeholder
for _ in range(3):
    pass  # do nothing (placeholder)


Useful when sketching code structure.

⚙️ Real Automation Examples
Rename Every File in a Folder
from pathlib import Path

folder = Path("C:/files")

for i, file in enumerate(folder.glob("*.pdf")):
    file.rename(folder / f"document_{i}.pdf")

Read a File Line by Line
with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())

API Pagination
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/users?page=1"

while url:
    res = requests.get(url).json()
    process(res["data"])    

    url = res.get("next_page")  # stop when no next page

🧠 Best Practices for Loops
Keep loops small & focused

Long loops → messy code
Short loops → maintainable automation

Prefer for loops when iterating collections

for loops are safer and cleaner than while.

Use list comprehensions for transformations
squares = [x*x for x in range(10)]

Avoid modifying a list while looping over it

Dangerous patterns cause bugs.

📝 Quick Reference
for item in collection:
    ...

for index, item in enumerate(collection):
    ...

for i in range(start, stop, step):
    ...

while condition:
    ...

break      # exit loop
continue   # skip iteration
pass       # do nothing
