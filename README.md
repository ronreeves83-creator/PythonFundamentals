# PythonFundamentals
These are my core notes for strengthening Python skills, especially with automation in mind. Clean, simple, and straight to the point.

Python Automation Learning Repo

This repository documents my journey toward mastering Python for automation, cloud workflows, SaaS engineering, and real-world productivity scripts. It includes notes, examples, mini-projects, and reusable snippets I can plug into larger systems I’m building.

The goal is simple:
Level up Python skills while building practical tools that automate everyday tasks.

🚀 What’s Inside

📌 Purpose of This Repo

This repo is my personal development guide to becoming highly skilled in Python-based automation. It supports my work in:

Cloud automation

AI SaaS development

DevOps workflows

Data processing

automation systems

Personal productivity scripts

If I ever forget something, the answer is in here.
If I learn something new, I add it here.
This repo grows as I grow.

🧠 Technologies & Tools

Python 3.x

requests, pathlib, schedule, BeautifulSoup, pandas

VS Code (primary editor)

Git + GitHub for version control

Virtual environments for isolation

🚦 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>


Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Install any project-level dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

✨ Learning Strategy

Add at least one new automation script per week

Document everything to reinforce memory

Create real use-cases tied to my cloud/SaaS goals

Build up from simple scripts → full workflows → deployable tools

📫 Future Plans

Add AWS Lambda automation templates

Build a CLI tool for everyday tasks

Add more web scraping examples

Create automation for spreadsheets and reporting

Build mini “SaaS-style” modules (logging, config handling, job scheduling)
